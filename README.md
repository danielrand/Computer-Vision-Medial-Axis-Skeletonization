# Computer-Vision-Medial-Axis-Skeletonization
A java implementation of image object skeletonization. 
This program extracts the "skeleton" or "medial axis" from objects in an image and compresses the image down into 
just its skeleton. Following the compression, the program will reconstruct the original image using only the 
medial axes in the compressed file. 

Here's some documentation on what a skeleton/medial axis is:
